Data Structures and Design Patterns in C#
This repository contains programs created to explore data structures and design patterns using C#. The programs cover a range of concepts and techniques such as linked lists, binary trees, and the factory pattern.

Installation
To run the programs, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the official .NET website.

In addition, you will need an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

Usage
To use the programs, you can open the project in your IDE of choice and compile the code. Each program is contained in a separate folder and can be run from the command line or by clicking the "Run" button in the IDE.

Before running the programs, you may need to modify the code to match your specific environment or requirements.

Credits
These programs were created by Jaimaica Daisy Eugenio as part of a course on data structures and design patterns using C#.
